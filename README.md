# SyncProxy step-by-step quick start guide for Ionic
Below is a quick start tutorial to how to setup an Ionic hybrid mobile application embedding its own database with **SyncProxy** client. Used together with online **SyncProxy** server (www.syncproxy.com), this is the quickest way to create an application that will synchronize bidirectionally, reactively in realtime with your backend database (MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB...), and also work perfectly when offline. Only with one line of code.

## Architecture
The **SyncProxy** client targets hybrid mobile applications (Ionic, Phonegap, Cordova, Xamarin...) with an embedded database (IndexedDB, SQLite, WebSQL...) that provides offline capabilities. By adding the **SyncProxy** client to your main .html file **with one single line of code**, you will turn your offline app into a powerfull online application with bidirectionnal reactive (realtime) sync that will work perfectly with or without connection. You will not need develop any specialized webservices, since the **SyncProxy** server enables to define sync profiles directly online on www.syncproxy.com which acts as a gateway between your app and your backend database.
